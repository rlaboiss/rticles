# Introduction

In order to assist authors in the process of preparing a manuscript for a journal, the Taylor & Francis ‘\textsf{Interact}’ layout style has been implemented as a \LaTeXe\ class file based on the `article` document class. A \textsc{Bib}\TeX\ bibliography style file and a sample bibliography are also provided in order to assist with the formatting of your references.

Commands that differ from or are provided in addition to standard \LaTeXe\ are described in this document, which is _not_ a substitute for a \LaTeXe\ tutorial.

The present file can be used as a template for a manuscript by cutting, pasting, inserting and deleting text as appropriate, using the preamble and the \LaTeX\ environments provided (e.g.\ `\begin{abstract}`, `\begin{keywords}`).

## The \textsf{Interact} class file

The `interact` class file preserves the standard \LaTeXe\ interface such that any document that can be produced using `article.cls` can also be produced with minimal alteration using the `interact` class file as described in this document.

If your article is accepted for publication it will be typeset as the journal requires in Minion Pro and/or Myriad Pro. Since most authors will not have these fonts installed, the page make-up is liable to alter slightly with the change of font. Also, the `interact` class file produces only single-column format, which is preferred for peer review and will be converted to two-column format by the typesetter if necessary during preparation of the proofs. Please therefore do not try to match the typeset format exactly, but use the standard \LaTeX\ fonts instead and ignore details such as slightly long lines of text or figures/tables not appearing in exact synchronization with their citations in the text: these details will be dealt with by the typesetter. Similarly, it is unnecessary to spend time addressing warnings in the log file -- if your .tex file compiles to produce a PDF document that correctly shows how you wish your paper to appear, such warnings will not prevent your source files being imported into the typesetter's program.

## Submission of manuscripts prepared using _\LaTeX_

Manuscripts for possible publication should be submitted to the Editors for review as directed in the journal's Instructions for Authors, and in accordance with any technical instructions provided in the journal's ScholarOne Manuscripts or Editorial Manager site. Your \LaTeX\ source file(s), the class file and any graphics files will be required in addition to the final PDF version when final, revised versions of accepted manuscripts are submitted.

Please ensure that any author-defined macros used in your article are gathered together in the preamble of your .tex file, i.e.\ before the `\begin{document}` command. Note that if serious problems are encountered in the coding of a document (missing author-defined macros, for example), the typesetter may resort to rekeying it.

# Using the `interact` class file

For convenience, simply copy the `interact.cls` file into the same directory as your manuscript files (you do not need to install it in your \TeX\ distribution). In order to use the `interact` document class, replace the command `\documentclass{article}` at the beginning of your document with the command `\documentclass{interact}`.

The following document-class options should _not_ be used with the `interact` class file:

* `10pt`, `11pt`, `12pt` -- unavailable;
* `oneside`, `twoside` -- not necessary, `oneside` is the default;
* `leqno`, `titlepage` -- should not be used;
* `twocolumn` -- should not be used;
* `onecolumn` -- not necessary as it is the default style.

To prepare a manuscript for a journal that is printed in A4 (two column) format, use the `largeformat` document-class option provided by `interact.cls`; otherwise the class file produces pages sized for B5 (single column) format by default. The `geometry` package should not be used to make any further adjustments to the page dimensions.

<!-- If your manuscript has supplementary content you can prepare this using the `suppldata` document-class option, which will suppress the `article history' date. This option must _not_ be used on any primary content. -->

# Additional features of the `interact` class file

## Title, authors' names and affiliations, abstracts and article types

The title is generated automatically from the information in the YAML header. The `type` field is also provided as an _optional_ element which should _only_ be included if your article actually needs it.

An additional abstract in another language (preceded by a translation of the article title) may be included within the `abstract` environment if required.

A graphical abstract may also be included if required. Within the `abstract` environment you can include the code
```
\\\resizebox{25pc}{!}{\includegraphics{abstract.eps}}

```
where the graphical abstract is to appear, where `abstract.eps` is the name of the file containing the graphic (note that `25pc` is the recommended maximum width, expressed in pica, for the graphical abstract in your manuscript).


## Abbreviations

A list of abbreviations may be included if required, enclosed within an `abbreviations` environment, i.e.\ `\begin{abbreviations}`\ldots`\end{abbreviations}`, immediately following the `abstract` environment.


## Keywords

A list of keywords may be included if required, enclosed within a `keywords` environment, i.e.\ `\begin{keywords}`\ldots`\end{keywords}`. Additional keywords in other languages (preceded by a translation of the word `keywords`) may also be included within the `keywords` environment if required.


## Subject classification codes

AMS, JEL or PACS classification codes may be included if required. The `interact` class file provides an `amscode` environment, i.e.\ `\begin{amscode}`\ldots`\end{amscode}`, a `jelcode` environment, i.e.\ `\begin{jelcode}`\ldots`\end{jelcode}`, and a `pacscode` environment, i.e.\ `\begin{pacscode}`\ldots`\end{pacscode}` to assist with this.


## Additional footnotes to the title or authors' names

<!-- The `\thanks` command may be used to create additional footnotes to the title or authors' names if required. Footnote symbols for this purpose should be used in the order -->
<!-- $^\ast$~(coded as `$^\ast$`), $\dagger$~(`$\dagger$`), $\ddagger$~(`$\ddagger$`), $\S$~(`$\S$`), $\P$~(`$\P$`), $\|$~(`$\|$`), -->
<!-- $\dagger\dagger$~(`$\dagger\dagger$`), $\ddagger\ddagger$~(`$\ddagger\ddagger$`), $\S\S$~(`$\S\S$`), $\P\P$~(`$\P\P$`). -->

Note that any `footnote`s to the main text will automatically be assigned the superscript symbols 1, 2, 3, etc. by the class file.^[If preferred, the `endnotes` package may be used to set the notes at the end of your text, before the bibliography. The symbols will be changed to match the style of the journal if necessary by the typesetter.]

# Embedding R code

## Code chunks

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Some guidelines for using the standard features of \LaTeX

## Sections

The \textsf{Interact} layout style allows for five levels of section heading, all of which are provided in the `interact` class file using the standard \LaTeX\ commands `\section`, `\subsection`, `\subsubsection`, `\paragraph` and `\subparagraph`. Numbering will be automatically generated for all these headings by default.

## Lists

Numbered lists are produced using the `enumerate` environment, which will number each list item with arabic numerals by default. For example,

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

Alternative numbering styles can be achieved by inserting an optional argument in square brackets to each `item`, e.g.\ `\item[(i)] first item`\, to create a list numbered with roman numerals at level one.

Bulleted lists are produced using the `itemize` environment. For example,

* First bulleted item
* Second bulleted item
* Third bulleted item

## Figures

```{r pressure-plot, fig.show='hide'}
plot(pressure)
```

The `interact` class file will deal with positioning your figures in the same way as standard \LaTeX. It should not normally be necessary to use the optional `[htb]` location specifiers of the `figure` environment in your manuscript; you may, however, find the `[p]` placement option -- i.e. `\begin{figure}[p]` -- or the `endfloat` package useful if a journal insists on the need to separate figures from the text.

Figure captions appear below the figures themselves, therefore the `\caption` command should appear after the body of the figure. For example, Figure&nbsp;\ref{sample-figure} with caption and sub-captions is produced using the following commands:
```
\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[An example of an individual figure sub-caption.]{%
\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{path/to/fig}}}\hspace{5pt}
\subfigure[A slightly shorter sub-caption.]{%
\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{path/to/fig}}}
\caption{Example of a two-part figure with individual sub-captions
 showing that captions are flush left and justified if greater
 than one line of text.} \label{sample-figure}
\end{figure}
```
\begin{figure}
\centering
\subfigure[An example of an individual figure sub-caption.]{%
\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{`r knitr::fig_chunk('pressure-plot', 'pdf')`}}}\hspace{5pt}
\subfigure[A slightly shorter sub-caption.]{%
\resizebox*{5cm}{!}{\includegraphics{`r knitr::fig_chunk('pressure-plot', 'pdf')`}}}
\caption{Example of a two-part figure with individual sub-captions
 showing that captions are flush left and justified if greater
 than one line of text.} \label{sample-figure}
\end{figure}

To ensure that figures are correctly numbered automatically, the `\label` command should be included just after the `\caption` command, or in its argument.

The `\subfigure` command requires `subfigure.sty`, which is called in the preamble of the `interacttfssample.tex` file (to allow your choice of an alternative package if preferred) and included in the \textsf{Interact} \LaTeX\ bundle for convenience. Please supply any additional figure macros used with your article in the preamble of your .tex file.

The source files of any figures will be required when the final, revised version of a manuscript is submitted. Authors should ensure that these are suitable (in terms of lettering size, etc.) for the reductions they envisage.

The `epstopdf` package can be used to incorporate encapsulated PostScript (.eps) illustrations when using PDF\LaTeX, etc. Please provide the original .eps source files rather than the generated PDF images of those illustrations for production purposes.


## Tables

The `interact` class file will deal with positioning your tables in the same way as standard \LaTeX. It should not normally be necessary to use the optional `[htb]` location specifiers of the `table` environment in your manuscript; you may, however, find the `[p]` placement option or the `endfloat` package useful if a journal insists on the need to separate tables from the text.

The `tabular` environment can be used as shown to create tables with single horizontal rules at the head, foot and elsewhere as appropriate. The captions appear above the tables in the \textsf{Interact} style, therefore the `\tbl` command should be used before the body of the table. For example, Table&nbsp;\ref{sample-table} is produced using the following commands:
\begin{table}
\tbl{Example of a table showing that its caption is as wide as
 the table itself and justified.}
{\begin{tabular}{lcccccc} \toprule
 & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Type} \\ \cmidrule{2-7}
 Class & One & Two & Three & Four & Five & Six \\ \midrule
 Alpha\textsuperscript{a} & A1 & A2 & A3 & A4 & A5 & A6 \\
 Beta & B2 & B2 & B3 & B4 & B5 & B6 \\
 Gamma & C2 & C2 & C3 & C4 & C5 & C6 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\tabnote{\textsuperscript{a}This footnote shows how to include
 footnotes to a table if required.}
\label{sample-table}
\end{table}
```
\begin{table}
\tbl{Example of a table showing that its caption is as wide as
 the table itself and justified.}
{\begin{tabular}{lcccccc} \toprule
 & \multicolumn{2}{l}{Type} \\ \cmidrule{2-7}
 Class & One & Two & Three & Four & Five & Six \\ \midrule
 Alpha\textsuperscript{a} & A1 & A2 & A3 & A4 & A5 & A6 \\
 Beta & B2 & B2 & B3 & B4 & B5 & B6 \\
 Gamma & C2 & C2 & C3 & C4 & C5 & C6 \\ \bottomrule
\end{tabular}}
\tabnote{\textsuperscript{a}This footnote shows how to include
 footnotes to a table if required.}
\label{sample-table}
\end{table}
```

To ensure that tables are correctly numbered automatically, the `\label` command should be included just before `\end{table}`.

The `\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule` and `\cmidrule` commands are those used by `booktabs.sty`, which is called by the `interact` class file and included in the \textsf{Interact} \LaTeX\ bundle for convenience. Tables produced using the standard commands of the `tabular` environment are also compatible with the `interact` class file.


## Landscape pages

If a figure or table is too wide to fit the page it will need to be rotated, along with its caption, through 90$^{\circ}$ anticlockwise. Landscape figures and tables can be produced using the `rotating` package, which is called by the `interact` class file. The following commands (for example) can be used to produce such pages.
```
\setcounter{figure}{1}
\begin{sidewaysfigure}
\centerline{\epsfbox{figname.eps}}
\caption{Example landscape figure caption.}
\label{landfig}
\end{sidewaysfigure}
```
```
\setcounter{table}{1}
\begin{sidewaystable}
 \tbl{Example landscape table caption.}
  {\begin{tabular}{@{}llllcll}
    .
    .
    .
  \end{tabular}}\label{landtab}
\end{sidewaystable}
```
Before any such float environment, use the `\setcounter` command as above to fix the numbering of the caption (the value of the counter being the number given to the preceding figure or table). Subsequent captions will then be automatically renumbered accordingly. The `\epsfbox` command requires `epsfig.sty`, which is called by the `interact` class file and is also included in the \textsf{Interact} \LaTeX\ bundle for convenience.

Please note that if the `endfloat` package is used, one or both of the commands
```
\DeclareDelayedFloatFlavor{sidewaysfigure}{figure}
\DeclareDelayedFloatFlavor{sidewaystable}{table}
```
will need to be included in the preamble of your .tex file, after the `endfloat` package is loaded, in order to process any landscape figures and/or tables correctly.


## Theorem-like structures

A predefined `proof` environment is provided by the `amsthm` package (which is called by the `interact` class file), as follows:
\begin{proof}
More recent algorithms for solving the semidefinite programming relaxation are particularly efficient, because they explore the structure of the MAX-CUT problem.
\end{proof}
\noindent This was produced by simply typing:
```
\begin{proof}
More recent algorithms for solving the semidefinite programming
relaxation are particularly efficient, because they explore the
structure of the MAX-CUT problem.
\end{proof}
```
Other theorem-like environments (theorem, definition, remark, etc.) need to be defined as required, e.g.\ using `\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}` in the preamble of your .tex file (see the preamble of `interactcadsample.tex` for more examples). You can define the numbering scheme for these structures however suits your article best. Please note that the format of the text in these environments may be changed if necessary to match the style of individual journals by the typesetter during preparation of the proofs.


## Mathematics

### Displayed mathematics

The `interact` class file will set displayed mathematical formulas centred on the page without equation numbers if you use the `displaymath` environment or the equivalent `\[...\]` construction. For example, the equation
\[
 \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
\]
was typeset using the commands
```
\[
 \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
\]
```

For those of your equations that you wish to be automatically numbered sequentially throughout the text for future reference, use the `equation` environment, e.g.
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
\end{equation}
was typeset using the commands
```
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\theta}_{w_i} = \hat{\theta}(s(t,\mathcal{U}_{w_i}))
\end{equation}
```

Part numbers for sets of equations may be generated using the `subequations` environment, e.g.
\begin{subequations} \label{subeqnexample}
\begin{equation}
     \varepsilon \rho w_{tt}(s,t) = N[w_{s}(s,t),w_{st}(s,t)]_{s},
     \label{subeqnparta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
     w_{tt}(1,t)+N[w_{s}(1,t),w_{st}(1,t)] = 0,
     \label{subeqnpartb}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
which was typeset using the commands
```
\begin{subequations} \label{subeqnexample}
\begin{equation}
     \varepsilon \rho w_{tt}(s,t) = N[w_{s}(s,t),w_{st}(s,t)]_{s},
     \label{subeqnparta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
     w_{tt}(1,t)+N[w_{s}(1,t),w_{st}(1,t)] = 0,   \label{subeqnpartb}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
```
<!-- This is made possible by the `amsmath` package, which is called by the class file. If you put a `\label` just after the `\begin{subequations}` command, references can be made to the collection of equations, i.e.\ `(\ref{subeqnexample})' in the example above. Or, as the example also shows, you can label and refer to each equation individually -- i.e.\ `(\ref{subeqnparta})' and `(\ref{subeqnpartb})'. -->

Displayed mathematics should be given end-of-line punctuation appropriate to the running text sentence of which it forms a part, if required.

### Math fonts

#### Superscripts and subscripts
Superscripts and subscripts will automatically come out in the correct size in a math environment (i.e.\ enclosed within `\(...\)` or `$...$` commands in running text, or within `\[...\]` or the `equation` environment for displayed equations). Sub/superscripts that are physical variables should be italic, whereas those that are labels should be roman (e.g.\ $C_p$, $T_\mathrm{eff}$). If the subscripts or superscripts need to be other than italic, they must be coded individually.

#### Upright Greek characters and the upright partial derivative sign
Upright lowercase Greek characters can be obtained by inserting the letter `u` in the control code for the character, e.g.\ `\umu` and `\upi` produce $\umu$ (used, for example, in the symbol for the unit microns -- $\umu\mathrm{m}$) and $\upi$ (the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter). Similarly, the control code for the upright partial derivative $\upartial$ is `\upartial`. Bold lowercase as well as uppercase Greek characters can be obtained by `{\bm \gamma}`, for example, which gives ${\bm \gamma}$, and `{\bm \Gamma}`, which gives ${\bm \Gamma}$.


# Acknowledgement(s) {-}

An unnumbered section, e.g.\ `\section*{Acknowledgements}`, may be used for thanks, etc.\ if required and included _in the non-anonymous version_ before any Notes or References.

# Disclosure statement {-}

An unnumbered section, e.g.\ `\section*{Disclosure statement}`, may be used to declare any potential conflict of interest and included _in the non-anonymous version_ before any Notes or References, after any Acknowledgements and before any Funding information.

# Funding {-}

An unnumbered section, e.g.\ `\section*{Funding}`, may be used for grant details, etc.\ if required and included _in the non-anonymous version_ before any Notes or References.

# Notes on contributor(s) {-}

An unnumbered section, e.g.\ `\section*{Notes on contributors}`, may be included _in the non-anonymous version_ if required. A photograph may be added if requested.

# Nomenclature/Notation {-}

An unnumbered section, e.g.\ `\section*{Nomenclature}` (or `\section*{Notation}`), may be included if required, before any Notes or References.

# Notes {-}

An unnumbered `Notes` section may be included before the References (if using the `endnotes` package, use the command `\theendnotes` where the notes are to appear, instead of creating a `\section*`).

# References

Different journals from Taylor & Francis have different requirements for formatting the list of references. The reference style will be one those:

- American Psychological Association reference style (APA)
- Chicago Author-Date reference style (CAD)
- National Library of Medicine reference style (NLM)
- Reference Style-P (TFP)
- Reference Style-Q (TFQ)
- Reference Style-S (TFS)

Authors must specify the required reference style in the YAML header of this file. For instance, this must be included when using the Chicago Author-Date reference style:
```
output:
  rticles::tf_article:
    reference_style: CAD
```

## References cited in the text

[CAVEAT: The only subsection below that will be correctly typeset is the one corresponding to the value specified in the `reference_style` field of the YAML header.]

### American Psychological Association reference style (APA)

References should be cited in accordance with \citeauthor{APA10} (APA) style, i.e. in alphabetical order separated by semicolons, e.g. ‘\citep{Ban77,Pia88,VL07}’ or ‘\ldots see Smith (1985, p.&nbsp;75)’. If there are two or more authors with the same surname, use the first author's initials with the surnames, e.g. ‘\citep{Lig08,Lig06}’. If there are three to five authors, list all the authors in the first citation, e.g. ‘\citep{GSSM91}’. In subsequent citations, use only the first author's surname followed by et al., e.g. ‘\citep{GSSM91}’. For six or more authors, cite the first author's name followed by et al. For two or more sources by the same author(s) in the same year, use lower-case letters (a,&nbsp;b,&nbsp;c, \ldots) with the year to order the entries in the reference list and use these lower-case letters with the year in the in-text citations, e.g. ‘(Green, 1981a,b)’. For further details on this reference style, see the Instructions for Authors on the Taylor & Francis website.

Each bibliographic entry has a key, which is assigned by the author and is used to refer to that entry in the text. In this document, the key `Nas93` in the citation form `\citep{Nas93}` produces ‘\citep{Nas93}’, and the keys `Koc59`, `Han04` and `Cla08` in the citation form `\citep{Koc59,Han04,Cla08}` produce ‘\citep{Koc59,Han04,Cla08}’. The citation `\citep{Cha08}` produces ‘\citep{Cha08}’ where the citation first appears in the text, and ‘\citep{Cha08}’ in any subsequent citation. The appropriate citation style for different situations can be obtained, for example, by `\citet{Ovi95}` for ‘\citet{Ovi95}’, `\citealp{MPW08}` for ‘\citealp{MPW08}’, and `\citealt{Sch93}` for ‘\citealt{Sch93}’. Citation of the year alone may be produced by `\citeyear{Sch00}`, i.e. ‘\citeyear{Sch00}’, or `\citeyearpar{Gra05}`, i.e. ‘\citeyearpar{Gra05}’, or of the author(s) alone by `\citeauthor{Rit74}`, i.e. ‘\citeauthor{Rit74}’. Optional notes may be included at the beginning and/or end of a citation by the use of square brackets, e.g. `\citep[p.~31]{Hay08}` produces ‘\citep[p. 31]{Hay08}’; `\citep[see][pp.~73-77]{PI51}` produces ‘\citep[see][pp. 73--77]{PI51}’; `\citep[e.g.][]{Fel81}` produces ‘\citep[e.g.][]{Fel81}’. A ‘plain’ `\cite` command will produce the same results as a `\citet`, i.e. `\cite{BriIP}` will produce ‘\cite{BriIP}’.

### Chicago Author-Date reference style (CAD)

References should be cited in Chicago author-date style, e.g. ‘\citep{Alb05,Gre08,Sch87}’ or ‘\ldots&nbsp;see Smith (1985,&nbsp;75)’. If there are three authors, list them all in every citation, e.g. ‘\citep{Nowacki20}’. For more than three authors, cite the first author's name followed by et al. For two or more sources by the same author(s) in the same year, use lower-case letters (a, b, c, ...) with the year to order the entries in the References list and use these letters with the year in the in-text citations, e.g. ‘\citep{FogEHPD04,FogJEE04}’. If two or more authors have the same surname, use their initials with the surnames, e.g. ‘(C.&nbsp;Doershuk 2010; J.&nbsp;Doershuk 2009)’. If the first author's names and the years of publication are identical for several references, include enough co-author names to eliminate ambiguity, e.g. `(Schonen, Baker, et&nbsp;al. 2009; Schonen, Brooks, et&nbsp;al. 2009)'. For further details on this reference style, see the Instructions for Authors on the Taylor \& Francis website.

Each bibliographic entry has a key, which is assigned by the author and is used to refer to that entry in the text. In this document, the key `Fow89` in the citation form `\citep{Fow89}` produces ‘\citep{Fow89}’, and the keys `{Bro86,Bro02,Roh08}` in the citation form `\citep{Bro86,Bro02,Prinzie09}` produce ‘\citep{Bro86,Bro02,Prinzie09}’. The appropriate citation style for different situations can be obtained, for example, by `\citet{Draper1987}` for ‘\citet{Draper1987}’, `\citealt{Lev05}` for ‘\citealt{Lev05}’, or `\citealp{Mor08}` for ‘\citealp{Mor08}’. Citation of the year alone may be produced by `\citeyear{Cho08}`, i.e. ‘\citeyear{Cho08}’, or `\citeyearpar{ChoGul08}`, i.e. ‘\citeyearpar{ChoGul08}’, or of the author(s) alone by `\citeauthor{Wittgenstein2009}`, i.e. ‘\citeauthor{Wittgenstein2009}’. Optional notes may be included at the beginning and/or end of a citation by the use of square brackets, e.g. `\citep[see][275]{Ell1968}` produces ‘\citep[see][275]{Ell1968}’; `\citep[e.g.][]{Wau50}` produces ‘\citep[e.g.][]{Wau50}’; `\citet[chap.~2]{Str00}` produces ‘\citet[chap. 2]{Str00}’. A ‘plain’ `\cite` command will produce the same result as a `\citet`, i.e. `\cite{Wei02}` will produce ‘\cite{Wei02}’.

### National Library of Medicine reference style (NLM)

References should be cited in accordance with US National Library of Medicine (NLM) style. References are cited in the text by a number in square brackets (e.g. [1], [2,4,10], [11--15], _not_ [11]--[15]), in the order in which they first appear. For further details on this reference style, see the Instructions for Authors on the Taylor \& Francis website.

Each bibliographic entry has a key, which is assigned by the author and is used to refer to that entry in the text. In this document, the key `Jen05` in the citation form `\cite{Jen05}` produces ‘\cite{Jen05}’, and the keys `{Sch02,Wen95}` in the citation form `\cite{Sch02,Wen95}` produce ‘\cite{Sch02,Wen95}’. The citation for a range of bibliographic entries (e.g.\ ‘\cite{Sha78,AG98,Smi75,Men05,DCK03,Hor98,Ant03,Zha05,Rog05,SRW05}’) will automatically be produced by  `\cite{Sha78,AG98,Smi75,Men05,DCK03,Hor98,Ant03,Zha05,Rog05,SRW05}`. Optional notes may be included at the beginning and/or end of a citation by the use of square brackets, e.g.\ `\cite[cf.][]{Gau05}` produces ‘\cite[cf.][]{Gau05}’, `\cite[p.356]{BGC04}` produces ‘\cite[p.356]{BGC04}’, and `\cite[see][p.73--77]{PI51}` produces ‘\cite[see][p.73--77]{PI51}’.

### Reference Style-P (TFP)

References cited in the text should be quoted by italic numbers in parentheses (e.g.\ (_1_), (_2_, _4_, _10_), (_11_--_15_), _not_ (_11_)--(_15_)), in the order in which they first appear. For further details on this reference style, see the Instructions for Authors on the Taylor \& Francis website.

Each bibliographic entry has a key, which is assigned by the author and used to refer to that entry in the text. In this document, the key `Gou02` in the citation form `\cite{Gou02}` produces ‘\cite{Gou02}’, and the keys `LeC03` and `Ban75` in the citation form `\cite{LeC03,Ban75}` produce ‘\cite{LeC03,Ban75}’. The citation for a range of bibliographic entries such as ‘\cite{Sah04,Hil90,Pul04,Kli04,Leo05,Wib74,McG02,Gar88,Zie03,Cha94,Moh04,ACSPD,Car01,Pus05,Mul05,Tay05,Squ05,Len04,Pet99,She04,Tsc04,Cha04}’ will automatically be produced by `\cite{Sah04,Hil90,Pul04,Kli04,Leo05,Wib74,McG02,Gar88,Zie03,Cha94,Moh04,` `ACSPD,Car01,Pus05,Mul05,Tay05,Squ05,Len04,Pet99,She04,Tsc04,Cha04}`. By using the `merge` option to `natbib`, citation keys within a multiple `\cite` command may contain a leading `*` that causes them to be merged in the bibliography together with the previous citation as a single entry with a single reference number. For example, `\cite{LP02,*LP04}` produces ‘\cite{LP02,*LP04}’, and both references are listed in the bibliography under one entry with that number.


### Reference Style-Q (TFQ)

References should be cited in the text by a number in square brackets (e.g. [1], [2,4,10], [11--15], not [11]--[15]) in the order in which they first appear. For further details on this reference style, see the Instructions for Authors on the Taylor & Francis website.

Each bibliographical entry has a key, which is assigned by the author and is used to refer to that entry in the text. In this document, the key `Ali95` in the citation form `\cite{Ali95}` produces ‘\cite{Ali95}’, and the keys `Wei95` and `GMW81` in the citation form `\cite{Wei95,GMW81}` produce ‘\cite{Wei95,GMW81}’. The citation for a range of bibliographic entries (e.g. ‘\cite{Bow76,Hor96,Con96,Har97,FGK03,Fle80,Ste98,Ell98,Str97,Coo03,BGP02,Kih01,Hol03,Hai01,Hag03}’) will automatically be produced by `\cite{Bow76,Hor96,Con96,Har97,FGK03,Fle80,Ste98,Ell98,Str97,Coo03,BGP02,` `Kih01,Hol03,Hai01,Hag03}`. Optional notes may be included at the end of a citation by the use of square brackets, e.g. `\cite[cf.][]{GHGsoft}` produces ‘\cite[cf.][]{GHGsoft}’, and `\cite[see][and references therein]{Pow00}` produces ‘\cite[see][and references therein]{Pow00}’.

### Reference Style-S (TFS)

References should be cited in the text by numbers in square brackets based on the order in which they appear in an alphabetical list of references at the end of the document (not the order of citation), so the first reference cited in the text might be [23]. For example, these may take the forms [32], [5,,6,,14], [21--55] (\emph{not} [21]--[55]). For further details on this reference style, see the Instructions for Authors on the Taylor \& Francis website.

Each bibliographic entry has a key, which is assigned by the author and is used to refer to that entry in the text. In this document, the key `Ali95` in the citation form `\cite{Ali95}` produces ‘\cite{Ali95}’, and the keys `Bow76` and `BGP02` in the citation form `\cite{Bow76,BGP02}` produce ‘\cite{Bow76,BGP02}’. The citation for a range of bibliographic entries (e.g. ‘\cite{GMW81,Hor96,Con96,Har97,FGK03,Fle80,Ste98,Ell98,Str97,Coo03,Kih01,Hol03,Hai01,Hag03,Hov03,Mul00,GHGsoft,Pow00}’) will automatically be produced by `\cite{GMW81,Hor96,Con96,Har97,FGK03,Fle80,Ste98,Ell98,Str97,Coo03,Kih01,` `Hol03,Hai01,Hag03,Hov03,Mul00,GHGsoft,Pow00}`.
Optional notes may be included at the beginning and/or end of a citation by the use of square brackets, e.g. `\cite[cf.][]{Tay03}` produces ‘\cite[cf.][]{Tay03}’, and `\cite[see][and references therein]{Wei95}` produces ‘\cite[see][and references therein]{Wei95}’.


## The list of references

Authors should create the list of references using a \textsc{Bib}\TeX\ database. \LaTeX/\textsc{Bib}\TeX\ will extract from your .bib file only those references that are cited in your text and list them in the References section. According to the chosen reference style, one of the following .bst files will be automatically used:

- APA: `apacite.bst`
- CAD: `tfcad.bst`
- NLM: `tfnlm.bst`
- TFP: `tfp.bst`
- TFQ: `tfq.bst`
- TFS: `tfs.bst`

Besides from `apacite.bst`, which is part of standard \LaTeX\ distributions, the files listed below should have been installed in the same directory of this skeleton file. You may delete the ones that are not needed.

Please include a copy of your .bib file and/or the final generated .bbl file among your source files.
